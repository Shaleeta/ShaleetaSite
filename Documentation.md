# Documentation for Messing Around in 607

### March 6, 2023

- Created a personal account on GitHub
- Updated SublimeText
- Downloaded the desktop version of Github & logged in to account
- Opened PUB607 on desktop, edited course, and pushed changes to main
- Created my own Repositiory (ShaleetaSite) to play with
- Turned on Pages (needed to make repo public first) *consider explaining what a repository is to students?*
- Pages not working, so troubleshooted by reading documentation
- Documentation from GitHub suggested adding a theme; attempts resulted in failure

- John went over pages setup, and discovered the missing element was a ReadMe.md file
- I deleted all extrenuous pages and created a ReadMe file; it worked!
- Attempted to find ways to make button on GitHub
- Made linked text enlarged, this could work as an easy download link (automatically changes colour)
- Reviewing posts discussing button creation on Markdown, and most involve using HTML or other languages for some parts or copying extra information
- Simplest dynamic method is to add a photo as a button and add a link for the photo... but this means using an external editor... 
- Can you float text over an image? If so you could have a static button image and just change the text as needed
- Alternatively, you could use the cover image as the dynamic button, and also use plain linked text?
