# Documentation for Messing Around in 607

### March 6, 2023

- Created a personal account on GitHub
- Updated SublimeText
- Downloaded the desktop version of Github & logged in to account
- Opened PUB607 on desktop, edited course, and pushed changes to main
- Created my own Repositiory (ShaleetaSite) to play with
- Turned on Pages (needed to make repo public first) *consider explaining what a repository is to students?*
- Pages not working, so troubleshooted by reading documentation
- Documentation from GitHub suggested adding a theme; attempts resulted in failure

### March 7, 2023

- John went over pages setup, and discovered the missing element was a ReadMe.md file
- I deleted all extrenuous pages and created a ReadMe file; it worked!
- Attempted to find ways to make button on GitHub
    - Made linked text enlarged, this could work as an easy download link (automatically changes colour)
    - Reviewing posts discussing button creation on Markdown, and most involve using HTML or other languages for some parts or copying extra information
    - Simplest dynamic method is to add a photo as a button and add a link for the photo... but this means using an external editor... 
    - Can you float text over an image? If so you could have a static button image and just change the text as needed
    - Alternatively, you could use the cover image as the dynamic button, and also use plain linked text? 
- This page wasn't rendering as Markdown, so looked into why... no clear reason, but I updated the local version (I've been working on the cloud) and it rendered finally
- Added a list of links to the end of each page to ensure people could navigate (look at better method later)
