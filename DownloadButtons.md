## Download Button Option #1
In this version, the button is an image file resized and linked to the appropriate source.

## Download Button Option #2
In this version, we forgo the button element and just use linked text that is bolded for emphasis. 

**[Download Audiobook](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=How+to+Download+an+Audiobook)**

## Download Button Option #3
In this version, similar to above, we use simple linked text. Here, though, we also indent this section.

> [Download Audiobook](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=How+to+Download+an+Audiobook)

Does the indent draw more attention? Is it as effective as a button?
