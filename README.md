# Shaleeta's Site

This is a GitHub site used to test material for PUB607, a technology in publishing course at SFU. See below for samples of buttons I've created (as a precursor to the download page) and for documentation (regarding my process creating this repository). Finally, I'm adding a list of questions I have about the universe. 

#### [My Version of the Course Schedule](Schedule.md)

#### [Download Buttons, Option One](DownloadButtons.md)

#### [Documentation](Documentation.md)

### Questions I've Had

- What is a repository, really? 
- How can I ensure students understand why we start at the basics?
